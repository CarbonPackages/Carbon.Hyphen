# Carbon.Hyphen Package for Neos CMS

## Make hyphens easier

Optional word-breaks are hard to enter in Neos CMS. This Neos package provides a helper to replace occurences of `||` with the Soft hyphen `&shy;`.

## Installation

Most of the time you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g. configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of that, it is important to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is the site packages located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```
composer require carbon/hyphen --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired package is now installed correctly.
